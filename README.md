### About this project
This project is a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood.
I have build this project from scratch, without any existing starter code to rely on.
The objective was to build an application using React framework that make requests to Google maps and Foursquare API's to search and fetch places provided, adding map markers to identify popular locations, adding a search function to easily discover these locations, a list view to support simple browsing of all locations and provide additional information about each of these locations.
